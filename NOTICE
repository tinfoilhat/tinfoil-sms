This software contains code derived from the video compression library
kanzi, written by Frederic Langlet, which is a collection of video compression
and processing utility classes in Java. While it is inteded for video 
compression, kanzi contains a large collections of sorting and compression 
algorithms written in Java. In particular we make use of and extended the 
Burrows Wheeler Transform (BWT) implementation as it is optimized for
performance. The original software is available from
